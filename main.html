		<h1>Non-English programming languages</h1>

		<h2>Why are most programming languages in English anyway?</h2>

		<p>Short answer: American hegemony.</p>

		<p>Longer answer: </p>

		<p>First, let me clarify what I mean: consider the programming languages nearest and dearest to your heart--JavaScript, Python, or Ruby, for instance. While JS was designed by American Brendan Eich, Python is the brainchild of Greenlandic Rasmus Lerdorf and Ruby of course was written by Japan's Yukihiro Matsumoto. Yet, the keywords used by all three languages derive incontrovertibly from the English vocabulary.</p>

		<div id='map'></div>

		<p>This map details the country of origin of the authors of seventy programming languages. Immediately, a few points are evident:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Over half of the authors hail from the United States and several more from other English-speaking countries.</li>
			<li>Geographic distribution is limited to developed states, and almost all of them are located in the global North.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>One last thing to consider</h2>

		<p>The original reason I looked into this topic is because I wanted to know how non-Anglo developers get into coding. If all popular contemporary programming languages are built in English, how does that affect tech's barriers to entry for those who don't speak the language? And if keywords and methods are defined semantically in English, how does the learning curve compare for native and non-native speakers? In short, who is disadvantaged?</p>

		<p>Technology has made the world smaller in countless ways, but as a community we should critically examine who writes the (literal) rules. Everyone should have equality of opportunity vis-Ã -vis participation in the digital economy and language accessibility is a crucial first step.</p>
